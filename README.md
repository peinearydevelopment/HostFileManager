# HostFileManager
Windows tray application which allows easy updating of hosts file

All of the core code of this project is taken from: https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/creating-tray-applications-in-.net-a-practical-guide/
I just tweaked the code to work in accordance with my use cases in mind.
